/**
 * TEST bundle for symfony functional testn that allows injecting
 * test doubles for multiple consecutive client requests.
 *
 * Suppose you have a functional test that:
 * * Renders a request
 * * Fetch the form, feeds it with data, submits the form
 *
 * These are two symfony requests, each in their own kernel and container.
 *
 * Say the second request creates a guzzle request to a third party, you
 * may want to substitute this request with a prophecy. To do that, this
 * service should be tagged with 'testDouble' in services_test.yml:
 *
 * services:
 *   App\Client\BambooClient:
 *       tags:
 *           - testDouble
 *
 * Adding this allows this bundle to add a revelation as test double per request:
 *
 * TestDoubleBundle::addProphecy('App\Client\BambooClient', $this->prophesize(BambooClient::class));
 *
 * Note a double has to be injected per request, so two are needed if the test
 * triggers two requests, so call addProphecy() multiple times.
 *
 * Note a service is NOT doubled but an instance of the real object is created if
 * a test does NOT provide (enough) prophecies.
 *
 * @codeCoverageIgnore Not testing testing related classes.
